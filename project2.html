              <h2>
              


              
                
                First of all, let me get something straight: This 
                is a Journal, not a diary. I know what it 
                says on the cover, but when Mom went out to 
                buy this thing I specifically told her to 
                get one that didn't say “diary” on it. 
             
                
                
                Great. All I need is for some jerk to catch me 
                
                
                carrying this book around and get the wrong idea. 
                
                
                
                The other thing I want to clear up right away 
                
                
                is that this was mom’s idea, not mine. 
                
                
                But if she thinks I’m going to write down my 
                
                
                “feelings” in here or whatever, she’s crazy. So 
                
                
                just don’t expect me to be all “Dear Diary” this 
                
                
                and “Dear Diary” that. 
                
                
                The only reason I agreed to do this at all is 
                
                
                because I figure later on when I’m rich and 
                famous, I’ll have better things to do than 
                answer people’s stupid questions all day long. So 
                this book is gonna come in handy. 
                
                
                GREGORY? 
                TELL US 
                ABOUT 
                YOUR 
                CHILDHOOD? 
                
                
                WERE YOU 
                
                ALWAYS 
                
                SO SMART 
                AND 
                
                HANDSOME? 
                
                
                Like I said, I’ll be famous one day, but for now 
                I’m stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons. 
                
                
                Let me just say for the record that I think 
                
                
                middle school is the dumbest idea ever invented. 
                You got kids like me who haven’t hit their 
                growth spurt yet mixed in with these gorillas who 
                need to shave twice a day. 
                
                And then they wonder why bullying is such a big 
                problem in middle school. 
                
                If it was up to me, grade levels would be based 
                on height, not age. But then again, I guess 
                that would mean kids like Chirag Gupta would 
                still be in the first grade. 
                
        
                Today is the first day of school, and right now 
                
                
                we’re just waiting around for the teacher to hurry 
                up and finish the seating chart. So I figured I 
                might as well write in this book to pass the time. 
                
                
                By the way, let me give you some good advice. On 
                the first day of school, you got to be real careful 
                where you sit. You walk into the classroom and just 
                plunk your stuff down on any old desk and the 
                next thing you know the teacher is saying — 
                
                
                I MOPE YOU ALL LIKE 
                WMERE YOU'RE SITTING, 
                BECAUSE THESE ARE YOUR 
                PERMANENT SEATS. 
                
                
                
                So in this class, I got stuck with Chris Hosey in 
                
                
                front of me and Lionel James in back of me. 
                
                Jason Brill came in late and almost sat to my 
                
                
                right, but luckily I stopped that from happening 
                 at the last second. 
                
                Next period, I should just sit in the middle of a 
                bunch of hot girls as soon as I step in the 
                room But I guess if I do that, it just proves 
                I didn’t learn anything from last year.

                Man, I don’t know what is up with girls these 
                
                
                days. It used to be a whole lot simpler back in 
                elementary school. The deal was, if you were the 
                fastest runner in your class, you got all the girls. 
                
                And in the fifth grade, the fastest runner was 
                Ronnie McCoy. 
                
                
                
                
                Nowadays, it’s a whole lot more complicated. Now 
                it’s about the kind of clothes you wear or how 
                rich you are or if you have a cute butt or whatever. 
                And kids like Ronnie McCoy are scratching their 
                heads wondering what the heck happened. 
                
                The most popular boy in my grade is Bryce 
                Anderson. The thing that really stinks is that 
                I have always been into girls, but kids like 
                
                
                Bryce have only come around in the last couple 
                
                
                of years. 
                
                6 
                
                
                I remember how Bryce used to act back in 
                
                
                elementary school. 
                
                
                /I DON’T TVIINKN

                But of course now I don’t get any credit for 
                
                
                sticking with the girls all this time. 
                
                
                Like I said, Bryce is the most popular kid in our 
                grade, so that leaves all the rest of us guys 
                scrambling for the other spots. 
                
                The best I can figure is that I’m somewhere 
                around 52nd or 53rd most popular this year. 
                
                But the good news is that I’m about to move 
                up one spot because Charlie Davies is above me, 
                and he’s getting his braces next week.

                friend Rowley (who is probably hovering right 
                around the 150 mark, by the way), but I think 
                it just goes in one ear and out the other with him

           <h2>
            Wednesday 

            Today we had Phys Ed, so the first thing I 
            did when I got outside was sneak off to the 
            basketball court to see if the Cheese was still 
            there. And sure enough, it was. 
            
          
            
            
            That piece of Cheese has been sitting on the 
            
            
            blacktop since last spring. I guess it must’ ve 
            dropped out of someone’s sandwich or something. 
            After a couple of days, the Cheese started getting 
            all moldy and nasty. Nobody would play basketball on 
            the court where the Cheese was, even though that 
            was the only court that had a hoop with a net. 
            
            
            Then one day, this kid named Darren Walsh 
            touched the Cheese with his finger, and that’s 
            what started this thing called the Cheese Touch. 
            
            
            It’s basically like the Cooties. If you get the 
            Cheese Touch, you’re stuck with it until you 
            pass it on to someone else. 
            
            
            
            Cheese Touch is to cross your fingers. 
            
            
            But it’s not that easy remembering to keep your 
            
            
            fingers crossed every moment of the day I ended 
            up taping mine together so they’d stay crossed 
            all the time. I got a D in handwriting, but it 
            was totally worth it. 
            
            
            This one kid named Abe Hall got the Cheese 
            Touch in April, and nobody would even come near 
            him for the rest of the year. This summer Abe 
            moved away to California and took the Cheese 
            Touch with him. 
            
            
            I just hope someone doesn’t start the Cheese 
            Touch up again, because I don’t need that kind 
            of stress in my life anymore. e first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate to move his capital from Delhi to Agra in 1504, and so he is regarded as being the founder of Agra. Sikandar Lodi's son, Ibrahim Lodi, was defeated at the Battle of Panipat in 1526 by Babur, which marked the beginning of Mughal Empire. In a brief interruption in Mughal rule between 1540 and 1556, Sher Shah Suri, established the short lived Sur Empire. Agra was the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1556 to 1648, under the Mughal Emperors Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan, after which Shah Jahan shifted the capital to Delhi. The Mughal Empire saw the building of many monuments, especially Taj Mahal. The city was later taken by the Jats and then Marathas and later still fell to the British Raj.

                  Yesterday Rodrick got a new heavy metal CD, and it had one of those “Parental Warning” stickers on it. I have never gotten to listen to one of those Parental Warning CDs, because Mom and Dad never let me buy them at the mall. So I realized the only way I was gonna get a chance to listen to Rodrick’s CD was if I snuck it out of the house. Thismorning, after Rodrickleft, I called up Rowley andtoldhimtobringhis CDplayerto school.
                  Then I went down to Rodrick’s room and took You’re not allowed to bring personal music players to school, so we had to wait to use it until after lunch when the teachers let us outside. As soon as we got the chance, me and Rowley snuck around the back of the school and loaded up Rodrick’s CD. But Rowley forgot to put batteries in his CD player, so it was pretty much worthless. Then I came up with this great idea for a game. The object was to put the headphones on your head and then try to shake them off without using your hands.

Manny got ahold of one of Rodrick’s heavy metal magazines, and one of the pages had a picture of a woman in a bikini lying across the hood of a car. And then Manny brought it into day care for show-and-tell. Anyway, I don’t think Mom was too happy about getting that phone call. I saw the magazine myself, and it honestly wasn’t anything to get worked up over. But Mom doesn’t allow that kind of stuff in the house. 41 Rodrick’s punishment was that he had to answer a bunch of questions Mom wrote out for him.

It includes the eponymous main island of Mauritius and Rodrigues, Agaléga and St. Brandon.[9][10] The islands of Mauritius and Rodrigues form part of the Mascarene Islands, along with nearby Réunion, a French overseas department. The capital and largest city, Port Louis, is located on Mauritius, where most of the population is concentrated. The country spans 2,040 square kilometres (790 sq mi) and has an Exclusive Economic Zone covering 2.3 million square kilometres. <br>
            <br>Arab sailors were possibly the first to discover the uninhabited island around 975, which they called Dina Arobi. The earliest confirmed discovery was in 1507 by Portuguese sailors, who otherwise took little interest in the islands. The Dutch took possession in 1598, establishing a succession of short-lived settlements before abandoning their efforts in 1710. France took control in 1715, renaming it Isle de France. In 1810 the island was seized by Great Britain, and four years later France ceded Mauritius and its dependencies to Britain. As a British colony, Mauritius included Rodrigues, Agalega, St. Brandon, Tromelin, the Chagos Archipelago, and, until 1906, the Seychelles.[9][12] Sovereignty over Tromelin is disputed between Mauritius and France, as it was not specifically mentioned in the Treaty of Paris.[13] Mauritius remained a primarily plantation-based colony of the United Kingdom until independence in 1968. </h2>
